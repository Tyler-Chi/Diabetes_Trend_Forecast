# Still a WIP

# Objective

The goal of this project is to use various leading indicators to try predicting the diabetes rate of a population in the future. The leading indicators used in this project include health census data from the CDC, as well as unemployment data from the USDA.

# Motivation

I hope that this could be a useful tool for local governments to be able to anticipate the rising importance of healthcare funding -- and perhaps take measures to improve the health of their people.
